**abstract**
Deep Visual Proteomics (DVP) has emerged in recent years for linking protein abundance to complex cellular or subcellular phenotypes while retaining complete spatial information. However, few segmentation algorithms were specially designed to address the challenges of achieving highly accurate single-nucleus laser microdissection in DVP. Here, we introduce ApuShape, a novel workflow that combines a contour-level nucleus instance segmentation algorithm and a boundary refinement algorithm. The advantages of ApuShape could be evidenced as identifying and refining the nucleus shapes in two large-scale datasets testing. As a result, ApuShape produces refined nucleus shapes with highly accurate and coherent laser microdissection trajectories. Our results suggest that the proposed ApuShape raises a standard operating procedure to facilitate the analysis of input images in DVP.
